## Automated File Sorter in File Explorer

This notebook demonstrates how to use Python to automatically sort files in a file explorer. The code uses the `os` and `shutil` modules to create subdirectories for different file types, and then move the files to the corresponding subdirectories.

The code is as follows:

```python
import os
import shutil

# Get the path to the current directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()

# Create subdirectories for different file types
xlsx_directory = os.path.join(current_directory, "xlsx files")
jpg_directory = os.path.join(current_directory, "image files")
pdf_directory = os.path.join(current_directory, "pdf files")

# Create a list of all the files in the current directory
file_names = os.listdir(current_directory)

# Iterate over the list of files
for file_name in file_names:
    # Check the file extension
    if ".xlsx" in file_name:
        # Move the file to the xlsx files subdirectory
        shutil.move(file_name, xlsx_directory)
    elif ".JPG" in file_name:
        # Move the file to the image files subdirectory
        shutil.move(file_name, jpg_directory)
    elif ".pdf" in file_name:
        # Move the file to the pdf files subdirectory
        shutil.move(file_name, pdf_directory)

# Print a message to indicate that the files have been sorted
print("Files have been sorted!")


This code can be used to automatically sort files in any directory. To use the code, simply change the `current_directory` variable to the path of the directory that you want to sort.
